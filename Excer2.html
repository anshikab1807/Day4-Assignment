     Web development is the process of creating, building, and maintaining websites and web applications.
      It involves everything from web design to programming and database management. 
      Web development is generally divided into three core areas: Frontend Development, Backend Development, and Full Stack Development.

    In web technology, a database is a structured collection of data that is stored electronically and accessed via a web application. 
    It serves as the backend component where data is stored, managed, and retrieved. 
    Databases can be relational (like MySQL, PostgreSQL) using structured tables and SQL for queries, or non-relational (like MongoDB, CouchDB) which store data in flexible, document-oriented formats
